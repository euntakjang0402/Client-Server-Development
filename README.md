How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Clear documentation, uniform code style, and modular architecture are required when creating maintainable, understandable, and adaptive systems, such as Project One's CRUD Python module. Using this module in Project Two to link dashboard widgets to the database increased efficiency and reusability. It made the development process easier and more efficient. In the future, this CRUD module might be utilized in other applications that require database interactions, increasing productivity.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I tackle challenges systematically, beginning with requirements analysis, like I did with Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard. This project differs from earlier ones in that it needed the integration of several technologies and a more practical application. In the future, I plan to prioritize scalability and flexibility while developing databases, employing approaches such as normalization and selecting appropriate data models to fulfill the different demands of my clients.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists tackle issues with technology, which is essential in today's digital environment. My work on projects like Grazioso Salvare's dashboard helps to quickly organize and visualize data, allowing businesses to make more informed decisions. By automating and improving data-related procedures, I help to improve a company's efficiency and decision-making.
